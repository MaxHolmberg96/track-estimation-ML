# track-estimation-ML
### Comparing track estimation done by neural networks to conventional methods such as Hough Transform.

Hough transformation is found in hough.py and in the notebook hough_transform it is applied on data from TrackML Particle Tracking challange (https://www.kaggle.com/c/trackml-particle-identification/data).

Currently in the process of writing track estimation with convoutional nets instead of the hough transform.
